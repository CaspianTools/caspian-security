/**
 * Provider-prefixed token detection.
 *
 * Rationale for a separate file from `secretsRules.ts`:
 *   The original `CRED*` rules are heuristic — "looks like a password assignment",
 *   "high-entropy base64 literal". They run with `negativePatterns` and
 *   `contextAware: true` because their false-positive surface is wide.
 *
 *   These `TOKEN*` rules are the opposite: every pattern matches a token shape
 *   issued by a specific provider, with a shape only that provider produces.
 *   A match is almost never accidental, so severity is `Error` and no context
 *   filtering is applied. Users get per-provider stats in the learning
 *   dashboard (one rule code per provider) and can suppress one provider
 *   without turning off secret detection entirely.
 *
 * Shapes below were collected from each provider's documentation as of
 * 2026-04. Where a prefix is shared with legacy or sandbox tokens, the rule
 * is split so the live / production token is flagged as `Error` and the
 * sandbox / test variant as `Warning`.
 *
 * Every pattern uses word boundaries or character-class anchors to bound the
 * length match — no `.*` or unbounded quantifiers — which keeps them outside
 * the ReDoS guard's failure envelope.
