/**
 * Resolve the set of files that have changed since a given git reference.
 *
 * The canonical PR-scope invocation. CI workflows pass
 * `--changed-since origin/main` and scan only what this branch adds on
 * top of main — turns a 40-second full-repo scan into 2 seconds on
 * most PRs.
 *
 * Semantics mirror `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=d <ref>...HEAD`:
 *   - Three-dot syntax so the diff is "everything this branch added
 *     since it diverged from <ref>", not "everything different from
 *     <ref> right now" (which would include unrelated newer commits on
 *     <ref> itself).
 *   - `--diff-filter=d` excludes deletions — a file that no longer
 *     exists in HEAD is not scannable.
 *   - Working-tree / untracked files are NOT included by design. For a
 *     local dev workflow that needs dirty files, just run a full scan.
